# Feature Specification: Serverless Application Framework & Runtime

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a framework and a runtime that allows to run serverless applications written in javascript or in future other languages on different environments. For example, nodejs workers and child processes could be used by developers during coding to test locally. And docker or kubernetes environment could be used to run applications in production. In future new types of runtimes (e.g. AWS lambda, or GCP cloud run) could be supported as well."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or operator wants to run a serverless application (initially written in JavaScript, with future support for other languages) in a variety of environments. During development, they want to test locally using Node.js workers or child processes. In production, they want to deploy the same application to Docker or Kubernetes. In the future, they may want to target cloud runtimes such as AWS Lambda or GCP Cloud Run, without rewriting their application logic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a JavaScript serverless app, **When** the user selects the Node.js worker runtime, **Then** the app runs locally in a worker thread.
2. **Given** a JavaScript serverless app, **When** the user selects the child process runtime, **Then** the app runs locally as a child process.
3. **Given** a JavaScript serverless app, **When** the user selects the Docker runtime, **Then** the app runs in a Docker container.
4. **Given** a JavaScript serverless app, **When** the user selects the Kubernetes runtime, **Then** the app runs as a pod in a Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Given** a JavaScript serverless app, **When** the user selects a future runtime (e.g., AWS Lambda), **Then** the app can be executed in that environment with minimal changes.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the selected runtime is not available on the host?
- How does the system handle application errors or crashes in each environment?
- What if the application requires environment-specific configuration or secrets?
- How does the system handle scaling or concurrency in each runtime?
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are application inputs/outputs defined and passed between runtimes?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to run serverless applications in multiple environments (Node.js worker, child process, Docker, Kubernetes, and future cloud runtimes).
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a unified interface for launching, monitoring, and stopping serverless applications across all supported runtimes.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support JavaScript as the initial application language, with extensibility for other languages in the future.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow developers to test applications locally before deploying to production environments.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support adding new runtime types (e.g., AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run) with minimal changes to application code.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors and crashes gracefully, providing feedback to the user.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a way to configure environment-specific settings and secrets for each runtime.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support running multiple instances of an application for scaling and concurrency.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear documentation and examples for each supported runtime.
- **FR-010**: System MUST acceppt input parameters from user via HTTP requests and send thois request to serverless applciation over HTTP or inb future gRPC.
### Key Entities
- **Serverless Application**: The user’s code, written in JavaScript (initially), to be executed in different runtimes.
- **Runtime Environment**: The execution context (Node.js worker, child process, Docker, Kubernetes, future cloud runtimes).
- **Runtime Manager**: The component responsible for launching, monitoring, and stopping applications in a specific environment.
- **Configuration/Secrets**: Environment-specific settings and secrets required by the application.
