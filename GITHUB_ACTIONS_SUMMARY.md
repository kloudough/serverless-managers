## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### Required Actions for Repository Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   ```
   Repository Settings → Actions → General
   ✅ Allow all actions and reusable workflows
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets (Optional)**
   ```
   Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   
   CODECOV_TOKEN (optional)
   - Get from: https://codecov.io
   - Used for: Coverage reporting
   
   NPM_TOKEN (optional)
   - Get from: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens

   ```

3. **Set Workflow Permissions**
   ```
   Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
   ✅ Read and write permissions
   ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
   ```

4. **Configure Branch Protection (Recommended)**
   ```
   Repository Settings → Branches → Add rule
   
   Branch name pattern: main
   
   ✅ Require a pull request before merging
     ✅ Require approvals: 1
     ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals
   
   ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
     ✅ Require branches to be up to date
     Status checks required:
       - Test on Node.js 18.x

       - Test on Node.js 22.x
       - Build check
   
   ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Trigger CI Workflow

```bash
# Automatic on push to main/develop
git push origin main

# Automatic on pull request
gh pr create --base main --head feature/my-feature
```

### Create Release

```bash
# Option 1: Manual tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Option 2: Using npm version
npm version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
npm version minor  # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
npm version major  # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0

```

### View Workflow Status

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh run list
gh run view <run-id>
gh run watch

# Or visit in browser
# https://github.com/kloudough/serverless-managers/actions
```

### Test Locally with Act

```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
choco install act # Windows

# Run CI workflow
act push

# Run specific job
act -j test

# List workflows
act -l
```
